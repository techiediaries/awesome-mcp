# Awesome Model Context Protocol (MCP) 🚀  

> A curated roadmap and collection of resources for mastering the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — from fundamentals to advanced integrations.  
> Inspired by [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists.  

---

## 📚 Introduction  

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard introduced by Anthropic to connect AI models with external tools and data in a unified, interoperable way.  
This repo organizes the best resources from [Techiediaries](https://techiediaries.com) and [10xdev.blog](https://10xdev.blog) into a **progressive roadmap**.  

---

## 🐣 Beginner: Foundations  

- [The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Explained in 5 Minutes](https://techiediaries.com) — Quick intro to MCP architecture and setup with VS Code.  
- [MCP Explained in 10 Minutes: A Python Developer’s Crash Course](https://10xdev.blog) — Origins of MCP, host/client/server breakdown, comparison with function-calling.  
- [MCP Demystified: How the Model Context Protocol Standardizes AI Tool Use](https://techiediaries.com) — Big-picture view of MCP and tool interoperability.  
- [MCP Servers Explained in Under 10 Minutes](https://10xdev.blog) — Walkthrough of server concepts with a C# example.  

---

## ⚙️ Getting Started: Environment Setup  

- **VS Code + Copilot Setup** — Step-by-step guide to adding MCP servers (GitHub, Playwright, etc.) in `mcp-user-configuration.json`.  
- **FastAPI + MCP** — Build a simple Python MCP server, add it in VS Code using “MCP: Add Server”, and test with Copilot Chat.  
- **Copilot Integration** — Explore how Copilot uses MCP to create GitHub issues, PRs, and search repos as first-class tools.

## 👩‍💻 Build Your First MCP Servers  

- [Google Search MCP Server (Python)](https://techiediaries.com) — Beginner tutorial using `FastMCP` SDK to expose a Google Search tool.  
- [RAG MCP Server (PDF to Markdown)](https://10xdev.blog) — Intermediate tutorial: connect local docs with AI assistants using `doclink`.  
- [AI HR Agent MCP Server](https://techiediaries.com) — Multi-tool server (leave balance, history, requests) with Python SDK.  
- [Java MCP Server (No Spring)](https://10xdev.blog) — Implement MCP tools in Java with official SDK and test in VS Code Inspector.  

---

## 🛠 Hands-On Projects & Integrations  

- **Custom Tools for IDEs** — Create a FastAPI-based MCP server (e.g. jokes, date tools) and connect to VS Code Copilot.  
- **Repo Prompt MCP** — Use MCP as a bridge between editors (Repo Prompt ↔ Cursor IDE) for context sync.  
- **Practical Examples** — GitHub Copilot + MCP, RAG workflows, and knowledge-base tools.  

---

## 🔒 Advanced Topics  

- **Protocol Upgrades** — Learn MCP’s evolution from SSE (stateful) to **stateless HTTP transports** for scalable servers.  
- **Security Best Practices** — Explore MCP server vulnerabilities, isolation strategies, and the Context7 approach.  
- **Multi-language SDKs** — Extend MCP with Java, C#, and beyond.  

---

## 🗺 Roadmap Summary  

- **Step 1 (Beginner):** Read conceptual explainers → Install existing MCP servers → Try GitHub/Copilot integrations.  
- **Step 2 (Intermediate):** Build your own Python MCP servers (search tools, RAG, HR agent).  
- **Step 3 (Advanced):** Explore transports (HTTP, SSE), multi-language servers (Java, C#), and deploy production-ready tools.
